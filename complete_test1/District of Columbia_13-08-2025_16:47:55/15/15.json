      "og:description": "As online personally identifiable information, data breaches, blockchain, Artificial Intelligence, and other trends in the cyber ecosystem proliferate, courts must confront legal questions about data privacy that past courts have kicked down the road. One such question that courts and scholars have yet to properly interrogate is what constitutes \u201cunreasonable delay\u201d in violation of state data breach notification statutes.\nAll fifty states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Guam have laws requiring companies that hold data to provide notice to data subjects in the event such data is compromised. But courts have been able to punt the question of delay until now because data breach litigation often dies early, either because the statute does not provide a cause of action, or because the harm is too speculative to support a cause of action in negligence. With courts recognizing more statutory causes of action and more harms in negligence, the time to answer the question has come. ",
